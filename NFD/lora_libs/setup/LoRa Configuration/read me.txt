The lora_config file should be updated at your own risk. Doing so could cause errors upon initialization of the module. Only update it if you know what you are doing!

The first line indicates if the LoRa is waiting for an update. 1 is update, 0 is no update needed.
The second line is the debug value. This sets up how many messages you want.
Third line is the coding rate. This affects the on-air time/speed and the amount of errors. Values: 5-8
Fourth line is the Bandwidth. This affects the speed and range of the LoRa. Values: 125,250,500
Fifth is the spreading factor. This affects the range of the LoRa. Values: 6-12
Sixth is the frequency and channel. Needs to be the same as other LoRa to communicate. Values: 1-21
Seventh is the Power value. This affects how much power the LoRa uses and hence stronger messages. Values 1-5
Eighth is the Node address.
